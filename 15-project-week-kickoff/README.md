=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Today we'll have a discussion on diversity in tech, review the topics we've covered in the past 3 weeks, and then get going into project week!*

Song for the day: ["The Final Countdown" by Gabe The Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn5vJ0dhxXs)

- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) will be published late this afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Monday. It is a graded portion of this course, regardless of your intent to advance to a 401 course.

- The exam is open-book, open-Google, open-Stack_Overflow, whatever resources you want to use. The exam is designed to be, in spots, a little bit beyond what has been covered. The intent in those spots is to measure resourcefulness and ability to adapt and figure something out. Give yourselves adequate time for the exam: 1-2 hours depending if you are fast or slow on these kinds of things.

**Note:**

- Lunch & Learn with [Jon Peck of Algorithmia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peckjon/) at 12:15p today!
- The current 201 does final project presentations at 1:30p this afternoon... you should take a look at at least a couple of them!

`BREAK (10 minutes)`

**Additional topics related to final projects**

- General API craziness
- [CORS & JSONP](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/cors-and-jsonp.html) • [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) • [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
- Heroku requires [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) to access external resources
- Async fun... it'll happen to you!
- Reminder: [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en)
- Another HTTP testing ground: [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- The demo we did on the GitHub API would be useful if repurposed as an API sandbox to quickly get data to log into the console or view in the DOM, wouldn't it?
- Wanna do something cool and next-level? Go buy a domain name and point it at your Heroku deployment! Suggested site to use: [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) has a lot of $0.88 domains!

**Overall schedule from here on**

- Friday lab time:
	- Discuss project possibilities with your team
	- Begin testing/experimenting with APIs
	- Apply for API access if required! This is important if your API requires a key/token/etc.
	- As your ideas are coming together, bounce things off Sam & TAs to help manage project scope. Ideally these conversations can be held in group meetings with the entire team and all of the instructional staff, as much as possible

- Over the weekend
	- rest
	- relax
	- breathe
	- recuperate

- Tuesday morning
	- Get together with your team and complete the project proposal as outlined in the Day 16 README doc
	- Be sure to have a plan in place for your GitHub procedures within your team. This should be written down or shared in a document as THE source of truth
	- In addition to the project itself, be sure to put together a plan for how your team will address the problem domain and deconstruct it into tasks/TODO items
	- When your proposal is complete, meet with the instructional staff to get it reviewed and approved. After that you are ready to start building.

- Daily during project week
	- Standup meeting with instructional staff sometime during the morning
	- You should do at least one other standup with your team each day
	- You will have a daily report to fill out and submit in Canvas at the end of each day: don't forget these!
	- Sam (except for one-on-one meeting times and any other regular CF meetings) and some subset of the TAs will be available to you between 8:00a and 7:00p each day.
- Presentation Day schedule is TBA as of right now. Once it is settled it will be communicated to you ASAP.

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->
There are no new learning objectives for this day, since it is primarily a review/transition day.
