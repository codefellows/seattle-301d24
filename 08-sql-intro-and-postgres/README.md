# ![CF](https://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png)  Class 8: SQL & Postgres

## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Databases power web applications everywhere by enabling them to persist, modify, and query datasets to great effect. While there are many types of database options available now, Structured Query Language (SQL) remains the de facto standard for communicating with relational database systems. Let's build some SQL skills!*

*View today's and tomorrow's classes and labs as a big two-part structure. It's all the same basic subject, but way too much for one day, so we've split it.*

*There is NO new portfolio assignment associated with today, so that means you can focus on the lab assignment this afternoon and use any extra time to catch up leftover pieces of the portfolio assignments.*

**[Our Week 2 one-on-one meetings start today! Follow this link to sign up for a slot.](https://sam-301d23.youcanbook.me/)**

## Daily Plan

- Code Review
- Be aware that the setup and initialization challenges with the first run of a Postgres environment are often shared by individuals with the same operating systems. It's a good idea to gather in those tribes and share those details when getting started with today's

- [Postgres article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)

`10-minute break`

**Slides on SQL (41 slides, so this will take a while!)**

- A little more about REST to start off...

- CRUD
	- Databases as a resource
	- C = CREATE
	- R = READ
	- U = UPDATE
	- D = DESTROY (or DELETE)

- Relational Databases
	- Discuss differences between document based storage
	- Discuss common DBMS - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc
	- Discuss concepts of relational data

- SQL
	- Syntax
	- Statements
	- Clauses
	- Constraints
	- Expressions
	- Predicates
	- [SQL cheat sheet](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/sites/sql.su/)

- Data types
	- INTEGER
	- NOT NULL
	- PRIMARY KEY
	- CHAR
	- VARCHAR



`10-minute break`

- ***Review of lab code***

- Questions on the lab?

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand the basic concepts of databases

* Effectively use basic SQL commands to create, read, update, and delete rows from a table

* Understand the fundamental architecture of full-stack applications and how we can locally emulate them
