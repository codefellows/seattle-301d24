=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

Today we'll code together in an in-class workshop to wire up a new page in our blog app. This is done in lieu of a pair-programming assignment. You will individually fork/clone the lab code, get it working condition, and submit a pull request (by Monday at 12:59pm)just as you have been doing with the paired lab assignments.

Note that we probably will not get to 100% functionality in our workshop today *(gotta leave y'all a little bit of work to do, right?)*, and also that there are optional stretch goals.

We'll not work to a schedule, but instead work for an hour or so, take a break, etc., until we finish (or, more accurately, get as close to finished as we're going to get ;-).

## Daily Plan

**12:15-1:00p:** [Partner Power Hour](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/partner-power-hour-how-to-market-yourself-tickets-37815151135) with Vermouth, Inc.: *How to Market Yourself*.

  ```15 minute break```

- Code review

- Let's discuss and review the first week of 301!

  ```10 minute break```

- Start working on the form building workshop until we hit a good stopping point.

---

From this point on you'll have the the rest of the afternoon to work with a programming partner on a peer review of your portfolio progress, and to work together toward finishing and lingering goals from the Class 4 portfolio assignment.

You will have the weekend to complete and submit the fully working version of the blog form page.


## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants

* Recap the primary concepts discussed throughout the week.

    * "What have you learned so far?"

    * "What has been challenging to learn?"
