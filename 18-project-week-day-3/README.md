# Class 18 -  Project Week: Milestone 3

***By the end of day 3, students should have the core functionality of their application completed, in addition to doing a test deployment and beginning work on the application’s user interface and other associated components. It’s best to stress the importance of getting a baseline application (or test app) deployed by the end of the day, as this will help vet deployment issues prior to project presentations.***

## Development

1. Start with a meeting to assess how Tuesday went, and then plan Wednesday accordingly.

2. Your goal today: MVP. You want to have everything working, all of your core features in place, and bugs worked out. That will leave tomorrow for stretch goals and focusing on getting the look and feel dialed in to exactly what you want.

Keep in mind that as we get closer to Friday, it's never too soon to start thinking about presentations, and one step I'd encourage getting to at some point today is to test your project on one of the projectors in the classrooms. It just makes everything a little different to be viewed that way. We'll share some specific strategies for presentations tomorrow.
