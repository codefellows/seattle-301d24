![CF](https://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png)  Class 10: Functional Programming
=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*The focus of this class is on basic functional programming concepts through the use of the following array methods: `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`.*

Reminder: One-on-one meetings are ongoing! [Sign up for one](https://sam-301d23.youcanbook.me/) if you haven't already. Today's schedule as it currently stands:

- 2:00 - Darryl
- 2:15 - Duane
- 2:30 - Adam
- 2:45 - Thomas
- 4:00 - Ryan
- 4:30 - Stuart
- 4:45 - Mario

So, at the moment these are available: 3:00, 3:15, 3:30, 3:45, 4:15.

## Daily Plan

*"Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function.  Not a method.  Not a class.  Not a framework.  Just a function."* - [John Carmack](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/53512300451201024)

**Slides: Functional Programming**

**Lab Prep**

- Let's review the starter code and TODOs!

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand advantages of functional programming and reasons for its recent rise in popularity
* Correctly use **.forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce()** array methods to explore a data set
* Construct modularity with IIFE patterns
