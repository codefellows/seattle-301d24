=======
## Overview

*The focus of this class will be the underlying concepts of middleware and how to manage application state, through the use of a routing framework (PageJS).*

## Daily Plan

- Project sample! Here's another one!
	- [Seattle Field Finder](https://field-finder.herokuapp.com/)

- Let's review some basic calendar stuff for the coming days:

	- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) will be published Friday afternoon and be available until 8:59am Tuesday. It is a graded portion of this course, regardless of your intent to advance to a 401 course. This is longer and more challenging than the 301 entrance exam, so be sure to allow a couple of hours to take it.
	- To help you prepare for that, there will be an extra non-graded quiz published in Canvas tomorrow. It will give you a little more practice to get ready for the types of questions on the exam.
	- Reminder: Students aiming to take the JS or .NET 401s that start on 9/11 need to have all resubmits and any lingering coursework submitted by Tuesday morning. That is necessary for us to have time to grade those assignments and get the relevant information to Admissions. Everyone else has until the Sunday night after Project Week. If you have questions or want to discuss your situation personally, DM Sam to set up a time to go over things.
	- Reminder: Monday is a holiday (Labor Day). There will be no class, lab, or instructor/TA access. You are free to come in and use the space, but in the interest of mental health, you are encouraged to take a day of rest (or should we say REST?). GET a break, POST about it in your learning journal, PUT your mind at ease and your work plans in order, and DELETE any distractions for Project Week.

**Middleware?!?! What's that?**

**Slides: Middleware**

- What is it?
- Why are we using PageJS?
- The context object `ctx`, `next()`, and working with multiple callbacks in PageJS
- Working with URL params
